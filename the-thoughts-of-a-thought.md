# The Thoughts of a Thought

**By MD Abu Salehin**

---

I was on my own, sailing on my heart

Then suddenly, a voice came.

Saying that, "A hero or a villain?

What you want to be?"

Like others, I said, "The hero".

The voice again said,

"The hero who would kill his love to save the world?

Or,

The villain who could save his love and kill the whole world!"

The options were the same yet totally different.

I didn't know what to choose.

One side, my family and friends 

Other side, the eight billion

A good person would hesitate

But will choose the latter.

A bad person wouldn't hesitate

And will also choose the latter.

I don't know what to call myself,

Good or bad?" 

I would choose the former.

The voice again said, "So, you choose the villain?

Know that the family and friends you saved,

"Will blame you for saving them

And will also curse you, if you have killed them."

The choices are still the same

But my answer is not.

I am confused and don't know what to do.

Then I asked, "Is there a better option?"

He said, "You know better."

The riddles were all easy yet I can't answer.

Like that time passed and passed.

I was still sailing and thinking.

I don't know what to choose.

Thinking like that, another eon passed by

Yet I was still just thinking.

At the end, I lose

I asked for the answer.

The voice came and said,

"First, tell me who am I?"

I also thought about that

But again failed.

He said, "I am the one

on whom you are sailing.

I am the thought,

You are thinking."

"You are me?", I asked.

He said, "Not you but your thought."

"If you are my thought then why can't I answer?"

I again asked.

He said, "Because there is no answer."

I took a step back.

He again said, You are just a normal man.

You shouldn't think about it because

Even if you want to,

you could never be able to kill billions of people.

Those are just thoughts

Nothing more, nothing less."

Finally I understood.

I woke up from the dream.

I forgot everything except the fact that

A thought is just a fiction.

It's nothing to worry about.

Just live your life, like you would have.
