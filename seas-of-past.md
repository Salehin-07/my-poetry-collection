# Seas of Past

**By Md Abu Salehin**

---

Time was the sea, life was the boat,

I was the passenger and the destination was past.

<br>

First, it was the sea of old age.

I saw myself sitting on a chair

And wishing to become a child again

Where I don't have to work, 

don't have to think, 

Just do as I would like to.

<br>

Then the sea of youth came.

I again saw myself with full of responsibilities.

I was an adult but not as much as my father.

I started to realize how my father lived.

I had to take care of my family,

Take care of myself.

I just wanted to finish my duty and retire.

<br>

Then the last stop came, the sea of growing minds.

I saw myself with a bright smile,

Full of hope and fantasies in the eyes 

And just hoped to be an adult.

Like that the child thought,

"If I were to become an adult,

I would have everything to do.

No one would stop me, no restrictions."

<br>

The cycle of life is just like a joke

That no one laughs at.

The older one becomes,

The younger he wants to be.

The younger he was,

The older he wanted to be.

<br>
