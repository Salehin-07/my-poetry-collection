# UNKNOWN CRIMSON

**By Md Abu Salehin**

---

It was the night of the crimson moon,

I fell in love with her.

<br>

The gradient glow she makes

Is far greater than the mighty sun's.

<br>

Her rage could burn the fire,

Yet nothing looked more beautiful than her.

<br>

Her smile was so sweet

Even the sugar itself would feel shy around her.

<br>

She was the one I never met,

Nor do I know her name,

Yet she followed me in my mind

And became the crimson unknown.
