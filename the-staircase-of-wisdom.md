# The Staircase of Wisdom

**By Md Abu Salehin**

---

Life is the staircase of three steps,

Divided by wisdom.

<br>

The first is beginning,

Cursed by pride

But reachable for all.

They think they know everything,

Even while they know nothing.

<br>

The second step is realization,

Blessed by respect.

He knows that he knows

Yet he stays humble.

He respects everyone

And gets the same from others.

<br>

The last step is unknown,

Loved by the world.

He knows everything

There is for him to know

Yet he claims he knows nothing.

And that's true.

<br>

The more one learns,

The more humble he becomes.

The less one knows,

The more pride he will have.

<br>

I fear that.

What if I can't go to the second step?

What if I become arrogant?

That's why,

I decided to never step on the staircase

And stay on the ground.

The ground that will never have pride.

<br>
