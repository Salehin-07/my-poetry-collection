## ✨ Welcome

Welcome to my poetry collection—a sanctuary of verses where emotions take form and thoughts find their voice. Each poem here is a fragment of my inner world, crafted with vulnerability and honesty. I invite you to wander through these words, to feel what I felt, and perhaps discover something about yourself along the way.

Poetry is not just about reading; it's about experiencing. Let these verses speak to you.

## 📚 Poems

<div class="poem-grid">

### 🧠 [The Thoughts of a Thought](./the-thoughts-of-a-thought.md)
*A philosophical journey between the thought and the writer*

Dive into a metaphysical dialogue exploring the eternal question: Hero or villain? This poem unravels the paradox of impossible choices and the realization that sometimes, we are simply overthinking what never truly matters.

> *"A thought is just a fiction. It's nothing to worry about."*

---

### 🌊 [Seas of Past](./seas-of-past.md)
*A reflection on time, age, and the ironic cycles of life*

Travel through the seas of time—from old age to youth to childhood—and witness the beautiful irony of human desire. We spend our lives wanting what we don't have, never quite content with the present moment.

> *"The cycle of life is just like a joke that no one laughs at."*

---

### 💫 [Unknown Crimson](./unknown-crimson.md)
*A love poem to a muse never met, yet forever remembered*

Under the crimson moon, love blooms for someone who exists beyond reality—a mysterious figure who lives in the mind and heart. This is a testament to the power of imagination and the beauty of loving the unknown.

> *"She was the one I never met, nor do I know her name."*

## 🎭 About the Poet

I am **Md Abu Salehin**, a writer who believes in the transformative power of poetry. Through my verses, I explore the complexities of human emotion, the absurdities of existence, and the quiet beauty of fleeting moments.

Poetry, to me, is both a mirror and a window—a way to see myself more clearly while also offering others a glimpse into the universal experiences that connect us all.
